/**
 * A collection of [ViewBinding]s that can be used to display the stream of renderings
 * from a workflow tree.
 *
 * Two concrete [ViewBinding] implementations are provided:
 *
 *  - [LayoutRunner.Binding], allowing the easy pairing of Android XML layout resources with
 *    [LayoutRunner]s to drive them.
 *
 *  - [BuilderBinding], which can build views from code.
 *
 *  Registries can be assembled via concatenation, making it easy to snap together screen sets.
 *  For example:
 *
 *     val AuthViewBindings = ViewRegistry(
 *         AuthorizingLayoutRunner, LoginLayoutRunner, SecondFactorLayoutRunner
 *     )
 *
 *     val TicTacToeViewBindings = ViewRegistry(
 *         NewGameLayoutRunner, GamePlayLayoutRunner, GameOverLayoutRunner
 *     )
 *
 *     val ApplicationViewBindings = ViewRegistry(ApplicationLayoutRunner) +
 *         AuthViewBindings + TicTacToeViewBindings
 *
 * In the above example, note that the `companion object`s of the various [LayoutRunner] classes
 * honor a convention of implementing [ViewBinding], in aid of this kind of assembly. See the
 * class doc on [LayoutRunner] for details.
 *
 * Default bindings for the following types are provided, but can be overridden:
 *
 *  - [Named]`<*>` (Delegates to the registered binding for [Named.wrapped].)
 *  - [BackStackScreen]`<*>`
 *  - [AlertContainerScreen]`<*>` (Use [ModalContainer.forAlertContainerScreen] to set
 *    a different dialog theme.)
